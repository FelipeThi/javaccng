SUMMARY

JavaCC is an open source compiler compiler.  It takes a grammar
specification as input and produces a stand-alone parser written
in Java.

CONTENTS

This distribution contains the javacc, jjtree and jjdoc sources,
launcher scripts, example grammars and documentation. It also contains
a bootstrap version of JavaCC needed to build JavaCC.

BUILDING

You need Maven 2.1 or above to build JavaCC.

After you have checked out the sources, you will need to install
the provided javacc jar to the local maven repository to bootstrap
build process. Just run the following command in the project root dir:

  mvn install:install-file \
    -DgroupId=net.java.dev.javacc \
    -DartifactId=javacc \
    -Dversion=5.1 \
    -Dpackaging=jar \
    -Dfile=javacc-5.1.jar

This has to be done only once, to make it possible to build javacc
for the very first time.

The build is two-phase process. The first time you run maven, it builds
new javacc binary and installs it to the local repository. The second
time you run maven, it uses javacc binary that has just been built
to rebuild itself.
